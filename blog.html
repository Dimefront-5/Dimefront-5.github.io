              <h3> Previous EHC Lecture Reviews: Personal Security - 4/17/24</h3>
              <article>
                Since my time as an EHC officer has come to my end, I thought it would be fun to go back and talk about some of the other lectures I have made and my thought process behind why I made it/chose the topic. <br>
                
                Personal security is a lecture topic that I came up with shortly after I became a president of EHC. One of the issues we often run into with the start of every semester is lots of new potential members will show up and we used to start with a bootcamp.
                The bootcamp is a good idea, however it could be quite boring for people that have been in the club for a while and be a fire hose of information for newcomers. Also, I wanted to make a lecture that can be applicable to anyone and everyone from any background. <br>

                So, I decided to give a lecture on what I called "personal security". Basically, how can you keep yourself and your privacy safe instead of a company. 
                The lectures covers all sorts of different security topics, ranging from tools like passwords managers, VPNs, to topics like social engineering and phishing. The goal was to educate as many people as possible, and hopefully have them come back as they see cyber security doesn't have to be super complex. <br>

                There is no lab or workshop aspect, outside of me saying they need to download and use the tools and recommendations on what to use. I think the main issue with this lecture is it may come across as a cyber security awareness or training course. However, I think it is a good starting point for people that are new to the area and want to protect themself.
                <br>
                
                One thing you will see throughout my lectures is a lot of jokes on the bottom of the slides and some lighthearted humor. This actually started on this lecture creation, I wanted to make sure that people didn't think EHC was like a lecture from their professor and wanted to make it fun. It can be very easy to deliver a monotone lecture on computer science or security, so I wanted to bring some energy.
                
                <br>
                This is probably one of my favorite lectures I have made and revised and I hope it inspires you to make fun lectures that are approachable. Check the link to see my slides!

              <h3> RE/MA Lecture Series: Advanced Dynamic Analysis - 4/10/24</h3>
              <article>
                My final lecture for EHC and for the series of RE/MA was of course on advanced dynamic analysis. This entails just talking about debuggers and how to use them.
                Since most of the members have already gotten a crash course on assembly, there isn't much nuance to the debugging other than patching, breakpoints, and how you are God in a debugger.

                <br>I created a simple program that will not run if there is a debugger, base 64 encodes its strings and will create a fake exe file that doesn't run. For my demonstration, I walked through the labs made by PMA however, as the lab I created was more of a challenge for people that were inquisitive and wanted to see some examples of how real malware will attempt to hide it’s behaviors. 
                
                <br>
                I didn’t give time to work on their own, just because RE/MA needs a lot of hands-on experience and no one would be able to do the labs without any.
                <br>
	              I have really enjoyed getting to lead this lecture series, as it made me learn more about how to write some “malware” (even though my stuff wasn’t real). It also gave me a good review of topics I already know and strengthened my understanding. I would like to thank our previous officers for leading the way with these presentations and allowing me to build off of their great examples and demonstrations.

              <h3> RE/MA Lecture Series: Advanced Static Analysis - 4/3/24</h3>
              <article>
                This week, I continued my lecture series on RE/MA. This week, I covered advanced static analysis, which entails a crash course of x86 assembly language, the stack, and registers.<br>

                I also covered the tools to conduct advanced static analysis, such as IDA Pro and Ghidra however demoed using IDA. The goal of this workshop isn't to get them to start analyzing real world malware, unless they have a background with assembly. I hope if they are new to the area, they get a good bootstrap to understanding assembly and then learning the tools is something they can do on their own.<br>

                I created two simple crackmes to showcase the tools needed for advanced static analysis and how basic analysis isn’t enough. I also created a simple malware that deletes every file on the system, if given a password. I figured it would be fun for people to see how malware can truly mess up your system if you aren’t careful and to demonstrate why snapshots are important.

              <h3> RE/MA Lecture Series: Basic Analysis - 3/26/24</h3>
              <article>
                This week, I started my lecture series on RE/MA. This will be a three-part series where I cover RE/MA basics and the tools to conduct RE/MA. <br>
                This lecture series is always challenging because it is a lot of information in a short amount of time. It can be overwhelming to newcomers or people without a technical background. <br>
                My goal was to try to make this as approachable as possible and something they can continue to learn more about it in their own time.<br>
                I had fun trying to create my own simple labs to showcase RE/MA and creating x32 programs. With more time, I would've only used my own labs, but the PMA labs are a good starting point.
