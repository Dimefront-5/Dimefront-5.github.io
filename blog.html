              <h3> EHC Lecture Review: DNS, PKI, and TLS Certificates 5/1/2024</h3>

              <article>
                This assortment of topic ideas came from an officer who was interested in learning more on these topics. I decided to create a lecture revolving around PKI and TLS with an introduction to DNS. <br>

                PKI and TLS obviously relate, but DNS was somewhat of an outside topic to the other two. So, trying to work in why we were covering all three was fun to research and create.

                The main thing was realizing the best way to protect against dns typical dns attacks was to use DNSSEC which is a part of the PKI system. <br>

                I initially delivered this lecture in spring 2023, but then redelivered it for an Auburn's auburnhacks competition in 2024. I revamped and added some more context.  And gave a demonstration on what happens if we don’t have TLS enabled on a host on the internet. Then sadly got blocked from Auburn’s Wi-Fi for accidentally running Wireshark on my host. <br>

                I think one of the main things I wanted to stress was how PKI is basically a system of trust at the end of the day. We must trust that the certificates have been signed correctly and that they are who they say they are. The internet is built on trust at the end of the day. <br>

              <h3> EHC Lecture Review: Data Exploitation & Processing - 4/29/24</h3>

              <article>
                This lecture topic was the first EHC lecture I delivered when I became secretary of EHC. This lecture was inspired by a previous job experience from a summer internship.

                The inspiration came from me wanting to showcase how we can correlate data and other information to help make decisions on what is happening and how to track down bad guys. <br>The lecture was also chosen because at this point, I was nervous about what I could talk about.

                I wasn't confident in my abilities to present or on what I know, so the presentation is like some I had seen before. 
                
                <br> I later went back through and remade my lecture and delivered it again my final semester. I think it was a lot of fun on something that is crucial to investigations or in correlating data. It really puts you in the mind of someone who wants to investigate something.

                <br> I made my own labs with some help from some other interns and created a fun dataset that I could use for them to practice on. I tried to conduct each lab as a real investigation by only giving them limited information.

                <br> The hardest issue with this lecture is trying to fit all the material in a short amount of time. Most of the lecture was stuff we did over a week of training that I had condensed. I think it would be better to have a longer workshop to really get the material across.

              <h3> Previous EHC Lecture Reviews: Personal Security - 4/17/24</h3>
              <article>
                Since my time as an EHC officer has come to my end, I thought it would be fun to go back and talk about some of the other lectures I have made and my thought process behind why I made it/chose the topic. <br>
                
                Personal security is a lecture topic that I came up with shortly after I became a president of EHC. One of the issues we often run into with the start of every semester is lots of new potential members will show up and we used to start with a bootcamp.
                The bootcamp is a good idea, however it could be quite boring for people that have been in the club for a while and be a fire hose of information for newcomers. Also, I wanted to make a lecture that can be applicable to anyone and everyone from any background. <br>

                So, I decided to give a lecture on what I called "personal security". Basically, how can you keep yourself and your privacy safe instead of a company. 
                The lectures covers all sorts of different security topics, ranging from tools like passwords managers, VPNs, to topics like social engineering and phishing. The goal was to educate as many people as possible, and hopefully have them come back as they see cyber security doesn't have to be super complex. <br>

                There is no lab or workshop aspect, outside of me saying they need to download and use the tools and recommendations on what to use. I think the main issue with this lecture is it may come across as a cyber security awareness or training course. However, I think it is a good starting point for people that are new to the area and want to protect themself.
                <br>
                
                One thing you will see throughout my lectures is a lot of jokes on the bottom of the slides and some lighthearted humor. This actually started on this lecture creation, I wanted to make sure that people didn't think EHC was like a lecture from their professor and wanted to make it fun. It can be very easy to deliver a monotone lecture on computer science or security, so I wanted to bring some energy.
                
                <br>
                This is probably one of my favorite lectures I have made and revised and I hope it inspires you to make fun lectures that are approachable. Check the link to see my slides!

              <h3> RE/MA Lecture Series: Advanced Dynamic Analysis - 4/10/24</h3>
              <article>
                My final lecture for EHC and for the series of RE/MA was of course on advanced dynamic analysis. This entails just talking about debuggers and how to use them.
                Since most of the members have already gotten a crash course on assembly, there isn't much nuance to the debugging other than patching, breakpoints, and how you are God in a debugger.

                <br>I created a simple program that will not run if there is a debugger, base 64 encodes its strings and will create a fake exe file that doesn't run. For my demonstration, I walked through the labs made by PMA however, as the lab I created was more of a challenge for people that were inquisitive and wanted to see some examples of how real malware will attempt to hide it’s behaviors. 
                
                <br>
                I didn’t give time to work on their own, just because RE/MA needs a lot of hands-on experience and no one would be able to do the labs without any.
                <br>
	              I have really enjoyed getting to lead this lecture series, as it made me learn more about how to write some “malware” (even though my stuff wasn’t real). It also gave me a good review of topics I already know and strengthened my understanding. I would like to thank our previous officers for leading the way with these presentations and allowing me to build off of their great examples and demonstrations.

              <h3> RE/MA Lecture Series: Advanced Static Analysis - 4/3/24</h3>
              <article>
                This week, I continued my lecture series on RE/MA. This week, I covered advanced static analysis, which entails a crash course of x86 assembly language, the stack, and registers.<br>

                I also covered the tools to conduct advanced static analysis, such as IDA Pro and Ghidra however demoed using IDA. The goal of this workshop isn't to get them to start analyzing real world malware, unless they have a background with assembly. I hope if they are new to the area, they get a good bootstrap to understanding assembly and then learning the tools is something they can do on their own.<br>

                I created two simple crackmes to showcase the tools needed for advanced static analysis and how basic analysis isn’t enough. I also created a simple malware that deletes every file on the system, if given a password. I figured it would be fun for people to see how malware can truly mess up your system if you aren’t careful and to demonstrate why snapshots are important.

              <h3> RE/MA Lecture Series: Basic Analysis - 3/26/24</h3>
              <article>
                This week, I started my lecture series on RE/MA. This will be a three-part series where I cover RE/MA basics and the tools to conduct RE/MA. <br>
                This lecture series is always challenging because it is a lot of information in a short amount of time. It can be overwhelming to newcomers or people without a technical background. <br>
                My goal was to try to make this as approachable as possible and something they can continue to learn more about it in their own time.<br>
                I had fun trying to create my own simple labs to showcase RE/MA and creating x32 programs. With more time, I would've only used my own labs, but the PMA labs are a good starting point.

              <h3>HashCracker - 4/29/2024</h3>
              <article>
                I recently finished my final course at Auburn University called Advanced Computer and Network Security. In the class we have a group project where we work on something cybersecurity related.  My partner and I decided to see if we could make a custom brute force password cracker that can detect hashes and crack them automatically. 
                <br>
                This was a fun project were trying to make something as efficient as possible became a major factor.  We decided to write the tool in GO, a language known for its efficiency and multithreading use. We called the tool “Hash Slinging Slasher” (SpongeBob Reference) and initially the creation was focused on being able to identify hashes and automatically crack them. 
                <br>
                At first thought, it may sound simple, but it is a lot more complicated than I originally realized. The lowest hanging fruit is just to look at the length of the hash, if the length is standard for an algorithm, then we know what algorithm to start cracking the hash with. This is a naïve approach, as some hashes have the same length as MD4 and MD5. That isn’t a definitive way to identify hashes, and most hashes don’t have different character sets that we can use to identify them either. 
                <br>
                We started to parse shadow files and used the initial hashing algorithm distinction to start automatically cracking passwords. A few issues, shadow only uses a couple of hashing algorithms and of course not every hash will be in a shadow file format. Another issue was with time related to working on the project of not being able to support yescrypt and bcrypt, we just didn’t have enough time to figure out how GO implements their hashing algorithms. 
                <br>
                In the future I would like to spend more time implementing other hashing algorithms and allowing users to just tell us the algorithm.
                <br>
                When it comes to efficiency, obviously our tool isn’t up to industry standard, but I wanted to make it as fast as possible. We did this through multithreading, for wordlists we just cut it into 20 threads and have each thread work on a different part of the wordlist. For iterative, we have 95 threads (one for each password possible character in ASCII) and have a thread iteratively crack a password with a different starting letter.
                
                <br>
                I also implement benchmarking in case a user needs to stop cracking, so they can pick back up where they left off and starting cracking hashes again. I did this by making each thread store the last guess in a text file in a folder related to the hash.  Not the most storage effective but I didn’t want to deal with concurrency issues and make the program slower. This was the fastest way I could figure out how to do this in the limited amount of time we had.
                <br>
                
                If you’d like to see our code and use it yourself, check the link out!
